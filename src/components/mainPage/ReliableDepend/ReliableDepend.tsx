                <p>
                    We're proud to be an official project under the benevolent .NET Foundation
                    umbrella - an independent, non-profit organization established to support
                    an innovative, commercially friendly, open-source ecosystem around the .NET
                    platform with corporate sponsorship from Microsoft, Amazon AWS, and many
                    others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This means you can count on us not disappearing tomorrow, and continuing to
                    reamin under steady development; a guarantee that similar libraries just
                    can't provide.

                <h2>Continuously improving</h2>

                <p>
                    We're quick to develop and release new major versions for keeping up with
                    changes and new trends in the ecosystem. In addition, we're keen to create
                    infrastructure to make minor incremental improvments easy to implement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're happy to look at any idea the community has for us, large or small,
                    so feel free to chat to us if you think there's a way we can improve!
